# Adds some more tech to (late) game.

## New Habs:
- Early tier-1 research lab providing 15 research
- More powerful fusion generator that uses exotic matter and antimatter to produce vast amounts of power, which is good as the other modules require a lot of power.
- More powerful solar farm that uses exotic matter and antimatter to produce vast amounts of power.
- Exotic matter production: uses antimatter and a lot of power to generate exotic matter
- More Antimatter production: upgrades of the supercollider, using exotic matter for even more antimatter production
- Synthesiser: A matter-energy converter that generates basic resources for a hab
- Metal Irradiator: Turns metals and noble metals into fissible
- Six advanced Mining-Habs (two per tier)  that consume exotics and/or antimatter for increased yield 
- An advanced Nanofactoring complex using exotic matter to produce more money an improve buildtime


## New Projects
