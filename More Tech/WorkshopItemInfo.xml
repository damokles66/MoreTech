  <Name>More Tech</Name>
  <Description>Adds some more tech to (late) game.
New Habs:
[list]
[*]Early tier-1 research lab providing 15 research
[*]More powerful fusion generator that uses exotic matter and antimatter to produce vast amounts of power, which is good as the other modules require a lot of power.
[*]Exotic matter production: uses antimatter and a lot of power to generate exotic matter
[*]More Antimatter production: upgrades of the supercollider, using exotic matter for even more antimatter production
[*]Synthesiser: A matter-energy converter that generates basic resources for a hab
[*]Metal Irradiator: Turns metals and noble metals into fissible
[*]Six advanced Mining-Habs (two per tier)  that consume exotics and/or antimatter for increased yield &lt;*!*&gt; important note see bottom&lt;*!*&gt;
[*]An advanced Nanofactoring complex using exotic matter to produce more money an improve buildtime
[/list]

Projects
[list]
[*]Future-Tech: Welfare providing increased welfare reduction of global warming.
[*]Repeatable faction project: Advanced Space Exploitation Studies (5% Space Mining boost)
[*]Two projects reducing hab bombing damage
